                                        Therefore, we elaborate here how it differs from other websites.
                                        Most diabetes predictors out there try to estimate the chance
                                        of getting diabetes with medical information such as BMI, blood sugar,
                                        blood pressure etc. (see e.g. <a href="https://mydiabcheck.ch/de/test">Diabetes Check of Group Mutuel</a>).
                                        Our approach also needs medical information
                                        (e.g. high blood pressure or heart disease) but it is easier
                                        to know if you have low blood pressure than the exact value of it.
                                        In addition to that we focus more on a person's lifestyle:
                                        Eating, drinking sugar-sweetened beverage and smoking habits are considered.
                                        So generally, the information the user of this website needs should be
                                        easily accessible. Our approach also might differ from other predictors
                                        in the technical aspects.</p>

                                        Our original data comes from a survey done in Austin, Texas between the years 2015
                                        and 2017 with 1'688 participants (Source:
                                        <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Public-Health-Diabetes-Self-Management-Educ/48iy-4sbg">
                                            Austin Public Health Diabetes Self Management Education</a>). First, we had
                                        to drop some columns of the dataset which were too specific for the USA. E.g.
                                        we dropped the insurance or the medical home category of the participants as
                                        the insurance system depends a lot on the country where you live in.
                                        Further, we dropped the variable "Carbohydrate Counting" as we believe
                                        that not too many people are doing it.
                                        Second, we had to clean the dataset (e.g. combining category "college" and "some college".
                                        Third, we put the participant's ages into bins: E.g. every participant in their twenties
                                        then belonged to the 20-29 bin.

                                        As an Artifical Intelligence can only handle numeric values we had to create dummy
                                        variables such that our AI could process the data:

                                        For an example see image below: In the original dataset there was the column Education Level which had
                                        four answers (1-8, 9-11, High School GED, College) but as the AI cannot interpret those
                                        values, we created four columns from this (dummy variables: Education Level_1-8,
                                        Education Level_9-11, Education Level_High School GED and Education Level_College)
                                        and put a 1 at the column/answer the participant selected and a 0 at the other columns.
                                        This was repeated for multiple columns.

                                        To train the AI we tried different models: First, linear models (e.g. logistic
                                        regression) then more advanced models (e.g. RandomForestClassifier). When we tried
                                        those models out we have seen that they unjustifiably misestimated the risk of
                                        getting diabetes of people with age between 60-69. Although, we tried out very positive
                                        behavior (e.g. never drinking sugar-sweetend beverages) entering 60-69 for the age
                                        always resulted in an assessment of having a high risk of diabetes. We came to the
                                        conclusion that the tree of the feature age must have a lot of weight in the
                                        RandomForestClassifier so that the diabetes risk is mainly decided by the age
                                        of the user. Therefore, we could not make use of it.

                                        In the end, we decided to train a Neural Network, more exactly a
                                        Multi-Layer-Perceptron. This is a Neural Network with more than one hidden
                                        layer (where the calculation of the weights and its decisions happen). We did a GridSearchCV
                                        to find the best hyperparameters of the MLP (click
                                        <a href="https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/gridsearchcv/">here</a>
                                        for more information on GridSearchCV). The best results were given with a learning rate of
                                        0.01, an alpha of 0.1 and the identity (linear) activation function.
                                        The activation function is used to calculate the output of a node in the Neural Network.
                                        The identity function is just f(x) = x, so there is no calculation needed.
                                        The learning rate controls the step-size in updating the weights of the nodes.
                                        Alpha is also called regularization term (in this case L2 regularization) and is intended to prevent overfitting
                                        (model is perfectly fitted on training data but is not able to generalize it for new data). For more information on these terms
                                        check the book called "Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing" of Yoav Goldberg (published in 2017).

                                        Through our project, we wanted to illustrate privacy by design and privacy by default in a transparent way with a userfriendly approach from the very start of this project.

                                        Privacy by design is a concept where privacy protection considerations must be taken into account into the design of the product or service that will collect, process or use personal data. This means that privacy must be a concern of the developers from the beginning in order to integrate it into the structure of the service
                                        (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/privacy-by-design/#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9CPrivacy%20by%20Design,in%20the%20technology%20when%20created">EU GDPR info</a>).
                                        For example, at the beginning of our project we had to take into consideration the principle of minimization of personal data, which requires that the collection of personal data is strictly limited to what is necessary for the realization of the service. No superfluous data should be collected if it has no use for the service.
                                        </p>

					<p class="txt">
                                        Privacy by default is the consequence of privacy by design, which implies that from the conception of the service or product, the highest level of privacy protection is implemented and applicable by default. This means that without any intervention from the user, all available measures to protect personal data and limit its collection must be ensured (<a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/privacy-default_en">EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR</a>).
                                        For example, when creating a UDP (UZH Diabetes Predictor) user account, the user is confronted with a box giving him the necessary instructions to understand the data he is about to disclose. This is an application of privacy by default insofar as access to personal data (email address, answers to the risk predictor test) is subject to the user's prior authorization, without which the site will not grant access to the information.

                                        The <b>Federal Act on Data Protection (FADP)</b> contains two specific regulations concerning the processing of personal data for research purposes, one for the private sector <b>art. 13 para. 2 e FADP</b> and the other one that concerns the federal bodies only <b>art. 22 FADP</b>. Since we are a group of private persons and in no event we are federal bodies, we are subject to a less stringent legal regime if the following conditions are met:

                                        Firstly, the purpose of the processing of personal data does not relate to persons. That means that the identity of the person whose data is processed plays no role for the processing and anonymized or at least pseudonymized data could also be used to achieve the same purpose. This is the case for our project where the processing concerns only the users’: email adress, username, password age, gender, educational level, diabetes status, heart disease, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes education, diabetes knowledge, fruit and vegetable consumption per week, sweet beverages consumption per week and physical exercise per week.

                                       . Secondly, the results of the research are published in a form that does not allow the identification of the persons concerned. As we guarantee, the results are not concerning the individuals taking the test at all, and our goal as explained above is completely else. We found our data on <a href="https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Public-Health-Diabetes-Self-Management-Educ/48iy-4sbg">
                                        Austin Public Health Diabetes Self Management Education</a> and our algorithm is set and will not be modified. Therefore big data and personal private information related to the different questions in the test would be irrelevant to collect for us.

                                        The <b>art. 13 par. 2 let. e FADP</b> therefore refers to situations in which non-anonymized data as the one on our website (given the email address linked to the information) are used for purposes that do not relate to individuals, which excludes research that is directly directed at individuals. "On the other hand there is the anonymous access to UDP, where no data is collected. Therefore the unregistered users are not concerned by the <b>FADP</b>.

                                        The researcher must use anonymized data within the limits of the project's possibilities, it refers to the principle of the <b>art. 4 par. 2 FADP</b> which cites the principle of good faith and proportionality i.e. without any possibility of attributing data to an identified or identifiable person or at the cost of excessive efforts. In our case, however, this was not technically possible because of the means of retrieving one's password for the user account, which is only possible via e-mail. Since participation in a project with an educational purpose like ours is optional, the data subject must also consent to the processing of his or her data and has at least the right to object. It should be noted that this consent is indispensable in the case of processing of data subject to professional secrecy, such as medical secrecy <b>art. 321bis of  the Swiss Criminal Code</b> (<b>SCC</b>), article that refers to the <b>LRH</b>.
                                        This privilege reserved for research projects does not, however, dispense with the need to provide information about the data processing. Thus, the data subject must be given all objective and complete information on the planned data processing in advance <i>“at the latest when the data is stored or if the data is not stored, on its first disclosure to a third party”</i> on according to <b>art. 14 par. 3 FADP</b>.

                                        The requirements to be met by the researcher can vary, since each research is seeking different purposes and therefore are subject to each individual case, which must be examined in the light of the context of the research and the specificity of the concrete cases <a href="https://lexing.ch/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/31.pdf">(FANTI 2017)</a>. The researcher, as the person responsible for data protection in the processing of personal data, will comply with the following points in particular in the context of his research project.

                                        Overall we think we can raise awareness on the diabetes II-type illness by this
                                        website, by adding the component of the people's lifestyle choices as an aspect
                                        of the illness. Nevertheless, we are aware that there are AIs out there which perform much better than our predictor e.g. by using more data.
                                        Additionally we think we can clearly point out to the user why we have chosen which legal measures and also further explain this measure.

                           requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. This work is necessary to ensure that the EU
                           continues to recognize Switzerland as a country with a sufficient level of data protection
                           so that the possibility of exchanging data with it is preserved.

                                           identify a person or indirectly identifiable for person without
                                           developing disproportionate means to find the identity of the user.
                                           So when we link a user's email address to their UDP profile, the data
                                           becomes identifiable to the user. In other words, in our case it becomes
                                           personal data from the moment the email address is given in order to

                                           sensitive <b>art. 3 let. c par. 2 FADP</b>. Indeed, the questions to be

                                           require a certain level of discretion given the value of the information
                                           the user puts in if he or her is logged in. Thus, information such as

                                           sweet-beverage consumption, physical exercise</b></i> (because they
                                           could influence the risk of illnesses in this situation)

                                           given expressly <b>art. 4 par. 5 FADP</b>. No restrictions are foreseen
                                           in the <b>FADP</b>, but other laws are relevant for medical data as well.
                                           It is important to specify that for research projects collecting medical
                                           data, their processing is subject to the prior consent of the persons
                                           concerned (or to an authorization to lift professional secrecy in

                           understand on the Internet. It is inconvenient to have to flip through and compare clauses

                           means of proof for sales contracts in particular, clients are advised to always print
                           out or at least save the GTC with the date, as the online supplier can change them at
                           any time. Since the general conditions of use are not mandatory but an optional document
                           that can be submitted to the user of a service to regulate its use. It is a contractual
                           document but as opposed to a negotiated contract, the user does not have the possibility
                           to negotiate, he or she must choose between either to accept the terms of use and thus he
                           or she can use the website or to refuse and leave the website.

                                           some misunderstandings that could arise as a result of the value of the
                                           information on our site. This therefore protects us from possible legal
                                           claims that someone could have against UDP. Even if the Swiss liability
                                           law is not as strict as e.g. the one of the United States, and the nature of this
                                           project in the frame of a University class, we wanted to protect ourselves
                                           as much as possible, given the medical nature that could potentially lead
                                           to confusion. The disclaimer and the limitation of liability are here for
                                           this reason.</p>

                                           the purpose of this academic project which is not a medical research at

                                           By accepting the privacy policy the user does so and this is done
                                           of his or her own free will since the test is optional and a large margin
                                           of choice is offered to the user. In addition to this, we have decided to put a

                                           that the message gets through to the user. The disclaimer also requires

                                            sole purpose of this work is to illustrate the complementarity of law
                                            and artificial intelligence through this website. We are not doctors and

                                            carried out or the reception of the newsletter does not constitute in
                                            any case a follow-up or a medical consultation and does not aim at
                                            replacing it. The test performed does not replace a consultation with
                                            a doctor. It is strongly recommended to consult a doctor or a
                                            professionally competent and qualified specialist on the spot

                                            the advice of your doctor or other qualified health care provider on
                                            any matter relating to your health. Never neglect or delay seeking
                                            professional medical advice based on information obtained through the
                                            service. If you think you have a medical emergency or need treatment,

                                           <b>art. 100 of the Swiss Civil Code of Obligations SR 220</b> (<b>CO</b>),
                                           in the limits of the <i>'scope of compensation'</i> <b>art. 99 CO</b>. In
                                           addition to the <b>art. 100 CO</b>, the expression has a more general scope
                                           in everyday language. It means that, in one way or
                                           another, the beneficiary of the exclusion intends not to assume any
                                           responsibility towards the other party for a particular situation. The
                                           clause is thus intended to modify the legal situation that would result,
                                           without its adoption in the agreement, from the commitments assumed and
                                           or the applicable legal rules. The clause removes, from the party who accepts it, the advantages which without it,
                                           the party would be protected to a certain extend by the law.
